# Lunch Reports

To start the project run the following commands:

```
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py loaddata initial_data.json --app lunchreports
```

Imagine it's lunch time at a school with teachers & students. The purpose of this project is to generate two styles of reports:

1.  Report for each specific lunch item
2.  Combined report for all lunch items

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Please share as much as code as possible. The purpose of this exercise is to evaluate how you would generate similar reports, while handling the differences.

## Please see EXAMPLE_RESULTS for example reports.
